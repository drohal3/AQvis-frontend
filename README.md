# Backend for IdealAQ sensor data monitoring app
This app was completed as part of [Full-stack open](fullstackopen.com/en/) course. Additionally, the created solution aims to serve as a useful tool for [IdealAQ](https://idealaq.com/) project with a potential to be the base or a case study for future production version of the web app.

The app is used as a frontend for data visualisation app.

The backend app is in its own repository ([AQvis-backend](https://github.com/drohal3/AQvis-backend)).
